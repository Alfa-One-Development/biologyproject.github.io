            <p>A mitose é responsável por aumentar a quantidade de células de um embrião, pela cicatrização, crescimento
                de um organismo, por aumentar o número de células iguais ou regenerar tecidos.

                A mitose ocorre em células somáticas e células precursoras de gametas. Um dos objetivos da mitose é
                aumentar a quantidade de células, por esse motivo também está presente na reprodução assexuada de alguns
                organismos.

                Além da mitose, existe outro processo de divisão celular chamado de meiose. A diferença entre os tipos
                de divisão celular é que na mitose o processo é equacional, enquanto na meiose, reducional.

                A mitose é considerada equacional, pois as células-mãe, geram filhas idênticas. Por outro lado, a meiose
                é reducional, porque as células-mãe geram filhas com metade do material genético.</p>

            <p>Mitosis (/maɪˈtoʊsɪs/) is a part of the cell cycle in which replicated chromosomes are separated into two
                new nuclei. Cell division by mitosis is an equational division which gives rise to genetically identical
                cells in which the total number of chromosomes is maintained.[1] Mitosis is preceded by the S phase of
                interphase (during which DNA replication occurs) and is followed by telophase and cytokinesis, which
                divide the cytoplasm, organelles, and cell membrane of one cell into two new cells containing roughly
                equal shares of these cellular components.[2] The different stages of mitosis altogether define the
                mitotic phase (M phase) of a cell cycle—the division of the mother cell into two daughter cells
                genetically identical to each other.[3]

                The process of mitosis is divided into stages corresponding to the completion of one set of activities
                and the start of the next. These stages are preprophase (specific to plant cells), prophase,
                prometaphase, metaphase, anaphase, and telophase. During mitosis, the chromosomes, which have already
                duplicated during interphase, condense and attach to spindle fibers that pull one copy of each
                chromosome to opposite sides of the cell.[4] The result is two genetically identical daughter nuclei.
                The rest of the cell may then continue to divide by cytokinesis to produce two daughter cells.[5] The
                different phases of mitosis can be visualized in real time, using live cell imaging.[6]

                An error in mitosis can result in the production of three or more daughter cells instead of the normal
                two. This is called tripolar mitosis and multipolar mitosis, respectively. These errors can be the cause
                of non-viable embryos that fail to implant.[7] Other errors during mitosis can induce mitotic
                catastrophe, apoptosis (programmed cell death) or cause mutations. Certain types of cancers can arise
                from such mutations.[8]

                Mitosis occurs only in eukaryotic cells and varies between organisms.[9] For example, animal cells
                generally undergo an open mitosis, where the nuclear envelope breaks down before the chromosomes
                separate, whereas fungal cells generally undergo a closed mitosis, where chromosomes divide within an
                intact cell nucleus.[10][11] Most animal cells undergo a shape change, known as mitotic cell rounding,
                to adopt a near spherical morphology at the start of mitosis. Most human cells are produced by mitotic
                cell division. Important exceptions include the gametes – sperm and egg cells – which are produced by
                meiosis. Prokaryotes, bacteria and archaea which lack a true nucleus, divide by a different process
                called binary fission</p>
